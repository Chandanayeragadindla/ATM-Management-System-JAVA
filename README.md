# ATM-Management-System-JAVA
The ATM Management System is a Java-based application that simulates the core functionalities of an automated teller machine (ATM). The system allows users to perform basic banking transactions like withdrawing cash, depositing money, checking balances, and viewing transaction history, with built-in security features to protect user data.
Technologies Used:
Java (Core Java)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
Exception Handling
File Handling
Key Features:
User Authentication:

The system requires users to enter a valid PIN to access their accounts. Incorrect attempts are tracked and limited to prevent unauthorized access.
Cash Withdrawal:

Users can withdraw money from their account, provided the account has sufficient balance. The system ensures that the user is only allowed to withdraw multiples of available denominations (e.g., 10s, 50s).
Deposit Functionality:

Users can deposit cash into their account, and the system updates the balance accordingly. Deposits are stored and reflected in the userâ€™s transaction history.
Balance Inquiry:

The system allows users to check their current balance at any time, providing them with updated information on their available funds.
Transaction History:

A log of recent transactions is maintained for every user. Users can view their past withdrawals, deposits, and balance updates to ensure full transparency.
File Handling:

Account information, transaction records, and user data are stored in files to persist even after the system is closed, ensuring that data is not lost.
Security Features:

PIN verification ensures secure login for every user. Additionally, transaction data is logged for audit purposes to prevent fraudulent activities.
Error Handling:

Exception handling is used throughout the system to manage unexpected errors (such as insufficient funds or incorrect PIN entries) and provide meaningful messages to users.
Outcome:
The ATM Management System is a fully functional and secure application that demonstrates a clear understanding of Java concepts like object-oriented programming, exception handling, and file management. It offers a realistic simulation of an ATM, making it ideal for practical demonstrations in real-world banking systems. This project showcases my ability to develop applications that are not only functional but also secure and user-friendly.
